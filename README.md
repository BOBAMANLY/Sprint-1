# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This code is to help teach myself the C++ language. 

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}
This C++ program plays the card game known as Hi-Lo. A card is drawn and you will decide if the next card that will be drawn will be higher or lower than the current card. If the card is higher and you guessed that correctly, you earn 100 points. If it is lower and you guessed correctly, another 100 points. If you are incorrect, you lose 75 points.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This software was written so that I might be able to learn teh basic syntax and usage in the C++ language. This was a code that I had previously written in Python, but I thought that converting code that I understood would be beneficial for quick learning. Although I had the code written in another language, I had to convert some syntax and styling so that it would be compatible for a different coding language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

Written in C++
Coded in VS Code, with multiple extensions installed.
One extension was installed so that the .exe file that was produced would run more easily on VS Code.
