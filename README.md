# Overview


This code was written to help teach myself the C++ language and to leave some personally written examples in the language. 

This C++ program plays the card game known as Hi-Lo. A card is drawn and you will decide if the next card that will be drawn will be higher or lower than the current card. If the card is higher and you guessed that correctly, you earn 100 points. If it is lower and you guessed correctly, another 100 points. If you are incorrect, you lose 75 points.

This software was written so that I might be able to learn teh basic syntax and usage in the C++ language. This was a code that I had previously written in Python, but I thought that converting code that I understood would be beneficial for quick learning. Although I had the code written in another language, I had to convert some syntax and styling so that it would be compatible for a different coding language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Written in C++
Coded in VS Code, with multiple extensions installed.
One extension was installed so that the .exe file that was produced would run more easily on VS Code.

# Future Work

* A better user interface.
* Reading highscores to a file.
* Seperate the classes into their own files and read to each other.
